# Panel

The Calagopus **Panel** is the central management interface for administering game servers and related services. It provides a user-friendly web interface and a robust backend to handle server orchestration, user management, and various integrations. This will not actually host any game servers yet, for that you will need to install [Wings](../wings/overview.md).

## Minimum Requirements

Before installing the Calagopus **Panel**, ensure that your system meets the following minimum requirements:

- **Operating System**: Windows 10 or later, MacOS, Ubuntu 22.04 LTS or later, Debian 11 or later, or anything that supports modern Docker versions
- **CPU Architecture**: x86_64, ARM64, RISC-V or PPC64LE (when using extensions, only x86_64 and ARM64 are supported)
- **RAM**: Minimum 512 MB (1 GB or more recommended, 2 GB recommended when using extensions)
- **Disk Space**: At least 1 GB of free disk space, at least 10 GB recommended when using extensions

### Real World Usage Example

Here is an example of a Calagopus Panel running with 50 servers managed on x86_64 hardware:

```bash
CONTAINER ID   NAME                 CPU %     MEM USAGE / LIMIT     MEM %     NET I/O         BLOCK I/O        PIDS
1d385d84abbc   rjns-control_web     0.00%     88.47MiB / 91.99GiB   0.09%     671MB / 258MB   473MB / 345MB    31
775c970479c2   rjns-control_db      0.00%     66.44MiB / 91.99GiB   0.07%     190MB / 163MB   228MB / 686MB    20
f5925cc2dd3f   rjns-control_cache   0.09%     3.832MiB / 91.99GiB   0.00%     293MB / 18MB    12.8MB / 332MB   7
```

Keep in mind that when using extensions you will need additional resources for compiling the panel frontend and backend.
This example only reflects the base panel usage without any extensions installed.

## Technical Overview

The Calagopus Panel is built using a modern web stack to ensure scalability, performance, and ease of use. Below is a high-level overview of its architecture:

### Frontend

The frontend of the Calagopus Panel is developed using React.js, providing a responsive and intuitive user interface. It communicates with the backend via RESTful APIs to perform various operations such as server management, user authentication, and configuration settings.

- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Framework**: [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)
- **State Management**: [Zustand](https://zustand.docs.pmnd.rs/)
- **Styling**: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- **Build Tool**: [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- **Linting**: [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/)

### Backend

The backend is powered by Rust, leveraging the axum crate for handling HTTP requests. It manages core functionalities such as user management, server orchestration, and database interactions.

- **Language**: :crab: Rust
- **Web Framework**: [`axum`](https://crates.io/crates/axum)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL via [`sqlx`](https://crates.io/crates/sqlx)
- **Caching**: Redis via [`rustis`](https://crates.io/crates/rustis)
- **Runtime**: [`tokio`](https://crates.io/crates/tokio)

Most of the other backend functionality is implemented from scatch or using smaller crates to keep dependencies minimal and avoid bloat.
